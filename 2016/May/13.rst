- After kids left for APEX, I started cleaning up. Finding Ethan's hat, which
  he fashioned from an ordinary black hat and black construction paper to make
  a stove-pipe-hat prop for himself, I gathered up Benny and drove the hat over
  to Lifebridge.

  - Ethan had to give a first-person talk about Abraham Lincoln today.

  - As I arrived, I received a text message from Patrick about my bringing the
    hat.

- I took Benny to gymnastics and to McDonald's afterward.

  - At McDonald's, I encountered Brad Jolly, who wanted to question me about
    notation for elemetary mathematics.

  - Apparently, there is some disagreement about it in the news lately.

  - I told him that I use my own non-standard notation:

    - Parentheses are only for passing an argument list to a function.

    - Square brackets are only for grouping.

    - Curly braces are only for set notation.

- I exchanged text messages with Dan Woods about scout camp.

  - Vanessa objects to scout camp in general, for our boys are not much
    interested, and to the week of July 17 in particular, for that is VBS week.

  - I had earlier told Dan, perhaps wrongly, that I am for Peaceful Valley.

  - However, the only available date for it is July 17. Letting him know about
    the VBS conflict only after he had already gone to bat for it with the
    Grundls is disappointing. I am reminded of why I should be very circumspect
    (and first to ask my wife) before ever giving anyone the impression that I
    am for a particular course of action.

  - Now Dan is reconsidering the possibility of BDSR on July 24.
    
    - This has the advantage of not conflicting the VBS.

    - It has also the advantage of being a bit cheaper than PV.

    - However, the older boys are tired of BDSR.

    - For my part, I think that the boys are spoilt by beautiful Colorado. A
      troop from the Midwest plains might love to have the opportunity to
      attend BDSR every year.
