This morning I started reading the section on the Trinity in
Garrigou-Lagrange's *Reality*. The Greek Fathers pronounced inscrutable the
revealed facts, that there is only One Son and that there is only One Holy
Spirit. Augustine made some progress in understanding each of the Persons as
distinguished by internal relationship, but Augustine was unable to say what
distinguishes filiation from spiration. Aquinas was able to show why there must
be only One Son and only One Holy Spirit. He provides the distinction between
generation and spiration.

While the fact of the Trinity requires revelation, there are clues in scripture
about Who the Son is. He is the Word; this means that He is the object of
intellection. Now the divine intellect is of the divine nature, and so it is
equally present in all Three Persons, but only the Father is the speaker of the
Word. The Word is the complete expression of the divine nature and is therefore
also the One God.
